### Description
Adds alerts when a gun turret, vehicle or artillery is out of ammo or has low ammo. The amount of ammo considered low can be configured. Alerts for turrets, vehicles and artillery can be disabled separately. Behaviour on vehicles with multiple ammo slots can be configured (for all vehicles at once). Alerts on other planets or space platforms can be enabled.
